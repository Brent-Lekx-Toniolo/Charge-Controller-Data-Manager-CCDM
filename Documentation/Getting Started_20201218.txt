Welcome to CCDM (Charge Controller Data Manager) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Getting Started document is designed to work with the following CCDM Version:
0.0.1 beta

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1:
Be sure you have the proper Python interpreter installed:
CCDM has been tested using Python Versions 3.8 and 3.9 


		Linux/Raspbian ->
		If you suspect you already have Python on your Linux machine, you can check in bash / terminal by entering:
		$ python3 --version

		To install the latest version of Python in Linux enter:
		# sudo apt-get install python3
	


		Windows ->
		If you suspect you already have Python on your Windows machine, you can check in cmd by entering:
		C:\User\User_Name> python3 --version

		To install the latest version of Python in Windows, visit the following website and download proper installer:
		https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
		Follow the online instructions
		
Step 2:
Next Install Pillow (PIL fork) and ImageTk Modules

		
		Linux/Raspbian ->
		Install Pillow by entering:
		# sudo apt-get install python3-pil

		Install imaging-tk by entering:
		# sudo apt-get install python3-imaging-tk

		
		Windows ->
		Install Pillow by entering:
		C:\User\User_Name> pip3 install pillow

Step 3:
Install CCDM on your device

		You may run CCDM on a PC or Raspberry Pi. 
		CCDM is very lightweight and does not require a lot of memory or HDD space.
		Once you've downloaded the CCDM repository you may unzip and then copy and paste the entire 
		"Charge-Controller-Data-Manager-CCDM" package to your devices desktop.


Step 4:
Configure IP Address of you Charge Controller
		
		Be sure your Charge Controller and what ever device you're running CCDM on (PC, Rasp Pi etc) are 
		networked together and able to communicate. Use Ping or similar networking tools to ensure proper
		communication infrustructure is in place.
		In the package installed above in step 3, locate the CCDM_config.py file.
		Open it with any text editor, find the line that looks like the following:

		CC_IP_ADDRS = ["192.168.30.101", "192.168.30.102", "192.168.30.103", "192.168.30.104"]

		Change the first adress "192.168.30.101" to whatever IP address your Charge Controller resides at on your network.
		Leave the other three addresses alone. Onto the next step.

Step 5:
Confirm / Configure path locations
		
		If you're running CCDM on a windows PC, you may save and close the CCDM_config.py file from the last step and skip onto the next step (6).
		If you are running CCDM on a Raspberry Pi you must change some configured path locations.
		In the same CCDM_config.py file used in the last step.
		You will see the following comment in a couple locations: #Paths to use for PC
		Then a few lines below will be a comment such as this: #Paths to use for pi
		Under each of the above you'll note some code setting variables to certain path locations.
		The default is to set up path locations for a Windows PC, these defaults must be commented out and the
		paths for pi must be uncommented. 
		- To comment the PC paths, simply insert a # in front of the line.
		- To uncomment the pi paths, simply remove the # in front of the line.
 		There are a total of three locations this must be done for the following path variables:
				IMAGES_PATH
				TEMPLATES_PATH
				LOGS_PATH
		Save and close the file.



Step 6:
Start CCDM

		In the package installed in step 3, locate and run CC_Data_Manager.py.
		Here are some examples:

		Linux/Raspbian ->
		In Linux/Raspbian it is suggested to start CCDM via bash / terminal by doing the following:
		- Navigate to /Charge-Controller-Data-Manager-CCDM/Software_Package_yyyymmdd 
		  (yyyymmdd will be whatever the current build date of the package happens to be)
		- $ python3 CC_Data_Manager.py


		Windows ->
		- Navigate to /Charge-Controller-Data-Manager-CCDM/Software_Package_yyyymmdd 
		  (yyyymmdd will be whatever the current build date of the package happens to be)
		- Start CCDM by double clicking the file CC_Data_Manager.py
